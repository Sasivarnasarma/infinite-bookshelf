"""
Writes the CI report (gates, tests, build artifact) as Markdown for the workflow's summary page.

Reads step outcomes and test counts from environment variables set by the `report` job in
.github/workflows/ci.yml, and prints the Markdown (CI appends it to $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY).
Run it locally with any of those variables set to preview the report.
